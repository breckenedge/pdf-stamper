## Description

Fill out PDF forms (templates) using iText's PdfStamper.

Features include:

* Text fields
* Checkboxes
* Circles, ellipses, rectangles
* PDF-417 Barcodes

You have to use JRuby or RJB. You need Adobe LiveCycle Designer
or Acrobat Professional to create the templates.

## Example
    pdf = PDF::Stamper.new("my_template.pdf")
  
    pdf.text :first_name, "Jason"
    pdf.text :last_name, "Yates"
  
    pdf.image :photo, "photo.jpg"
    pdf.checkbox :hungry
    pdf.ellipse(140, 380, 50, 13)
    pdf.rectangle(140, 380, 50, 13)
    pdf.circle(140, 380)
    
    # PDF-417 barcodes
    pdf.barcode("PDF417", "2d_barcode", "Barcode data...", AspectRatio: 0.5)
    
    pdf.save_as "my_output.pdf"

Here is how you use it in Rails.

    # In your controller.
    def send 
      pdf = PDF::Stamper.new("sample.pdf") 
      pdf.text :first_name, "Jason"
      pdf.text :last_name, "Yates" 
      send_data(pdf.to_s, :filename => "output.pdf", :type => "application/pdf",:disposition => "inline")
    end
